# Environmental Perception Analysis
## Overview
This analysis aims to explore the relationship between in-game player behaviors and their real-life environmental perceptions using a dataset derived from 640 game players of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH). The dataset encompasses various aspects such as socio-demographic profiles, COVID-19 concerns, environmental perceptions, game-playing habits, in-game behavior, and game-playing feelings. The ultimate goal is to identify key relations between players' in-game behavior and their environmental opinions, classifying individuals as either human-centric (Non Environmental Friendly) or Environmentalist (Environmentally Friendly) based on their responses to a questionnaire.

## Aim
The primary aim of this analysis is to identify relationships between players' in-game behavior and their environmental perceptions. Additionally, the analysis seeks to classify individuals as either human-centric or environmentalist based on their responses to the questionnaire.

## Methodology
* Data Quality: Conduct checks to ensure data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistent values.
* Data Characterization: Gain an in-depth understanding of the data structure and patterns. Identify relationships between variables and extract meaningful insights.
* Detailed Analysis: Utilize advanced analytical techniques and machine learning methods to explore the data deeply. Implement statistical tests and model fitting to uncover hidden insights and patterns.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes the "data_640_validated.csv" file, which contains 640 records and 96 columns. It includes information on the environmental worldviews and behaviors of ACNH players across various categories such as socio-demographic profiles, COVID-19 concerns, environmental perceptions, game-playing habits, in-game behavior, and game-playing feelings. The dataset also assesses players' environmental perceptions using the revised New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) scale.

## Conclusion
Understanding the relationship between in-game behaviors and real-life environmental perceptions can provide valuable insights into player behavior and attitudes, although they might not be entirely accurate since humans can separate games from reality, leading to a difference in their opinions. 
By identifying key relations and classifying individuals based on their environmental opinions, this analysis contributes to our understanding of the intersection between gaming and environmentalism.
